# Data Model

## Overview

The Credit Risk Research Agent combines unstructured policy documents, structured customer data, portfolio datasets, and generated decision intelligence to support policy research, credit risk assessment, and recommendation generation.

The solution follows a local-first architecture using PDFs, ChromaDB, SQLite, and CSV files.

## Data Design Principles

1. Separate structured and unstructured data.
2. Maintain explainable evidence for all recommendations.
3. Use synthetic data for demonstrations and testing.
4. Prefer local storage over cloud dependencies.
5. Support future agent expansion without major redesign.
