# Agent Design

## Overview

The Credit Risk Research Agent follows a modular, multi-agent architecture where each specialist agent owns a single business capability. A lightweight Coordinator Agent orchestrates interactions between agents while keeping business logic isolated within individual components.

The current implementation follows these architectural principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Separation of Concerns
- Repository Pattern
- Service-Oriented Design
- Explainability by Design
- Framework Independence
- Local-First Execution
- Extensibility

# Agent Responsibilities

## Coordinator Agent

### Purpose

Acts as the central orchestration layer for all user requests.

### Responsibilities

- Receive user requests
- Determine required business capabilities
- Route requests using the Intent Routing Service
- Invoke specialist agents
- Coordinate agent execution
- Aggregate responses
- Invoke Response Formatting Service
- Return standardized responses
- Log user queries
- Log agent execution metrics

### Internal Services

- IntentRoutingService
- ResponseFormattingService
- QueryLogger
- AgentExecutionLogger

### Does NOT

- Execute business rules
- Access databases
- Query policy documents
- Generate recommendations

---

# Policy Agent

## Purpose

Provide policy research capabilities using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Responsibilities

- Retrieve relevant policy documents
- Build retrieval context
- Construct LLM prompts
- Generate policy answers
- Cite supporting policy sources

### Internal Components

- RetrievalService
- LLMService

### Inputs

- Natural language policy question

### Outputs

- Policy answer
- Supporting citations

### Data Sources

- Credit Policy PDFs
- Chroma Vector Database

---

# Customer Agent

## Purpose

Provide customer-level credit risk assessment.

### Responsibilities

- Validate customer identifiers
- Retrieve customer profile
- Assess customer credit risk
- Generate executive risk summary
- Return standardized customer response

### Internal Components

# Response Formatting Service

## Purpose

Convert raw orchestration responses into presentation-ready outputs.

# Design Principles

1. Every agent owns a single business capability.
2. The Coordinator remains orchestration-focused and contains no business logic.
3. Agents communicate only through the Coordinator Agent.
4. Business logic is encapsulated within services.
5. Data access is isolated through repositories.
6. Presentation logic is isolated from orchestration.
7. All recommendations must be evidence-based and explainable.
8. The architecture remains framework-independent.
9. New agents can be added without modifying existing specialist agents.
10. The system is designed for local-first execution with future extensibility toward intelligent orchestration.
