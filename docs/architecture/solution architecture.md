# Solution Architecture

## Overview

The Credit Risk Research Agent is a modular, local-first Agentic AI platform designed to support credit analysts in researching lending policies, assessing customer creditworthiness, and producing explainable credit risk insights.

The solution follows a layered architecture that separates presentation, orchestration, business capabilities, data access, and infrastructure concerns.

Rather than relying on an external agent framework, the platform implements a lightweight, framework-independent orchestration model that emphasizes modularity, explainability, and extensibility.

The current implementation includes:

- Policy Research (RAG)
- Customer Credit Assessment
- Request Orchestration
- Intent-Based Routing
- Response Formatting
- Query Logging
- Agent Execution Logging

Future phases will introduce portfolio analytics, recommendation generation, and explainability workflows

**Minimum Requirements**

- Python 3.12+
- 8 GB RAM
- Internet Access (OpenAI API)

The architecture remains cloud-independent and is designed for local execution throughout development.



# Future Evolution

Future agents may include:

- Regulatory Agent : Monitors and interprets regulatory guidelines to identify impacts on credit risk policies and decision-making.
- Fraud Risk Agent : Detects suspicious customer behaviors and potential fraud indicators during credit assessment.
- Market Intelligence Agent : Analyzes macroeconomic, industry, and market trends that may influence portfolio risk and lending strategies.
- Collections Agent : Evaluates delinquent accounts and recommends collection, recovery, or customer engagement actions.

The architecture is designed to support additional agents without significant redesign.
