# 1. Purpose

The Business Rules Catalogue documents the business decision rules currently implemented by the Credit Risk Research Agent. These rules are intended for demonstration purposes and provide transparency into how customer assessments are derived during the MVP phases.
The rules are not institution-specific underwriting policies and should be regarded as configurable reference implementations.

# 2. Business Rules Overview

# Assumptions

- Assessment thresholds are illustrative and not based on a specific bank's credit policy.
- Customer data is synthetically generated for demonstration purposes.

# Future Enhancements

In Future Rollouts there are posssibilities to include a capability for users to update the Business Rules without changing the code.
