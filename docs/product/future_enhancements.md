# Requirements Analysis & Detailed assessment

## FE-01 — Agent Memory

**Business Value: High**

**Enablement of Memory capability for the agentic solution will provide:

- follow-up questions
- reduced repeated inputs
- richer customer conversations
- persistent analyst sessions

Example:

*Assess customer CUST000001*

...

*Now compare with last customer.*

...

*What was their utilization?*


**Complexity: High**

Following factors justify the complexity level:

- memory architecture
- session management
- context pruning
- retrieval strategy
- It also impacts almost every agent.

## Recommendation & Direction:

**Move until after multi-agent workflows exist.**

---------

## FE-02 — LangGraph / CrewAI Integration

**Business Value: Low**

Today the architecture already supports:

- orchestration
- routing
- modular agents

Adding LangGraph would mainly replace infrastructure that is already built.
Little new business capability.


**Complexity: Medium**

Migration & Introduction of the new framework would require the following:

- redesigning Coordinator
- changing execution model
- introducing framework dependency

## Recommendation & Direction:

Trea & Keep as an architecture experiment only.Not to be considered in future roadmap plan.

-----------------------


## FE-03 — Multi-session Conversation Context

**Business Value: Medium**

Enabling this capability would allow the agentic framework:

- Recall the converstation past conversationa and build context from it.
- Useful,Not essential.

**Complexity: Medium**

Enabling the capability would require the following:

- conversation persistence
- retrieval
- session management

## Recommendation & Direction:

Possible implemantion to be planned after Agent Memory.

---------------

## FE-04 — Human-in-the-loop Review

**Business Value: High**

Folloiwing would be achieved with the capability:

- Very valuable & effective  for credit decisions.
- Example:Recommendation -> Analyst Review -> Approve -> Store Decision
- Much closer to enterprise lending systems.
- Reduces risk concerns & brings transparency around whole process


**Complexity: Medium**

- Mostly UI and workflow related impact.
- minimal impact on existing agents.

## Recommendation & Direction
To be planned in future Phases as capacity is available.

-----------------

## FE-05 — Decision Trace Visualization

**Business Value: High**

Following are to be considered :

- Financial institutions care enormously about explainability.
- Builds credebility of the outcomes reached.
- Helps in monitoring and reviewing the decisions.

**Complexity:Medium**

- Almost everything already exists.
- Visualization work needs to be finished.

## Recommendation & Direction
To be plannned for the future phases as the capacity becomes available.

------------------------

## FE-06 — Intelligent Intent Classification & Routing

**Business Value: Very High**

Following considerations are associated with the capability:

- substatially reduces the dependency on dictionaries (No dictionary in a sense)
- Keyword maintencence overhead is removed completely.
- Better improved composite routing.
- Highly scalable as the solution grows with more agents.

**Complexity: Medium**

- Routing service already functioning as a separate component.
- Only a single component change required. Minimal impact to current solution.

## Recommendation & Direction
To be planned & prioritized as in the current Roadmap to reap benefits as early as possible.
