# Credit Risk Research Agent

An AI-powered, local-first, multi-agent decision support platform that demonstrates how Agentic AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, and explainable AI can be applied to enterprise Credit Risk decision support.

The solution enables credit analysts and underwriters to interpret lending policies, assess customer creditworthiness, and generate evidence-based decisions through collaboration between specialized AI agents.

The project has been intentionally designed as a portfolio solution to demonstrate modern AI solution architecture, software engineering principles, and credit risk domain expertise.

# Business Problem

Credit Risk teams rely on multiple sources of information before making lending decisions, including:

- Credit policies
- Underwriting guidelines
- Customer credit bureau information
- Income and repayment behaviour
- Portfolio performance
- Regulatory requirements

Analysts often spend considerable time navigating these sources, resulting in:

- Slow decision making
- Inconsistent policy interpretation
- Manual evidence gathering
- Limited explainability
- High onboarding effort for new analysts

The Credit Risk Research Agent addresses these challenges by combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with specialized AI agents that retrieve, analyze and explain credit risk information.

# Key Architectural Principles

The solution follows a number of core architectural principles:

- Local-first execution
- Modular multi-agent architecture
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Separation of concerns
- Repository Pattern
- Explainability by design
- Evidence-based decision support
- Extensible agent ecosystem
- Framework independence (no LangChain/CrewAI dependency)
- Configuration-driven behaviour

---

# Current End-to-End Workflow

The current solution supports multiple user journeys.

## Policy Research Workflow

1. User submits a policy question.
2. Coordinator Agent identifies policy intent.
3. Policy Agent performs semantic retrieval.
4. Relevant policy sections are retrieved from ChromaDB.
5. OpenAI GPT generates a grounded response.
6. Source citations are included.
7. Response is presented through the Streamlit UI.

---

## Customer Assessment Workflow

1. User requests assessment of a customer.
2. Coordinator Agent extracts the customer identifier.
3. Customer Agent retrieves customer information.
4. Customer Assessment Service evaluates customer risk.
5. Customer Summary Service generates an executive summary.
6. Response Formatting Service prepares a presentation-friendly output.
7. Final explainable assessment is presented to the user.

---

## Multi-Agent Workflow

For requests requiring both policy interpretation and customer assessment:

1. Coordinator Agent identifies multiple required capabilities.
2. Policy Agent retrieves relevant lending policy.
3. Customer Agent evaluates customer profile.
4. Responses are consolidated.
5. Evidence-based assessment is presented through a unified response.

---

# Explainability

A key objective of the solution is transparency.

Every customer assessment includes:

- Executive summary
- Risk classification
- Key strengths
- Risk factors
- Supporting evidence
- Business observations
- Policy citations (where applicable)

This ensures AI-generated responses remain interpretable and suitable for analyst review.

- SQLite provides structured customer data storage.
- Specialized agents own individual business capabilities.
- Coordinator Agent contains orchestration only.
- Business logic remains isolated within domain services.
- Explainability is treated as a first-class architectural concern.
- Response formatting is separated from business processing.
- Logging is designed for traceability and future observability.

# How to Run

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API Key
- Git

---

## One-Time Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure your OpenAI API key.

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

---


4. Build the Policy Knowledge Base

Run the ingestion pipeline to prepare the policy document repository.

1. Extract text from policy PDFs
2. Generate semantic chunks
3. Create local embeddings
4. Build the ChromaDB vector database

> This step only needs to be repeated when policy documents are added or modified.

---

5. Create the Customer Repository

Generate the synthetic customer repository and initialize the SQLite database.

The pipeline performs the following activities:

- Generate synthetic customer master data
- Generate bureau records
- Generate credit card accounts
- Generate loan accounts
- Generate transaction history
- Generate digital behaviour history
- Export intermediate CSV datasets
- Validate generated datasets
- Create the SQLite database
- Load all generated data into SQLite

> This step only needs to be repeated when regenerating the synthetic customer dataset.

----



## Launch the Application

Once the one-time setup is complete-

```bash
streamlit run src/UI/app.py
```

The Streamlit interface allows you to:

- Ask policy-related questions
- Assess customer credit risk
- Evaluate customers against lending policies
- View explainable policy evidence
- Review customer risk summaries
